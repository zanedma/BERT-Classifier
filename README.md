## Description
This was a final project for our Machine Learning class at UCSC. Given a movie review, the classifier attempts to detect the review sentiment (either positive or negative). The project was directly taken from [this kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial) however instead of using the "Bag of Words" approach we decided to explore neural network classifier options. Once we discovered the BERT SOTA classifier it was clearly a good candidate for our needs. The BERT classifier achieves around 93% accuracy on unlabled test data which the group was very happy. While we could have used a simpler Support Vector Machine and gotten around 89% accuracy, we wanted to expand our horizons and try to squeeze a bit more accuracy out of the classifier because there was a small competition bonus for this assignment.
